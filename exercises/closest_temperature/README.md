# Objective

Find the temperature closest to zero.

## Instructions

In this exercise, you have to analyze records of temperature to find the **closest to zero**.

Implement the function which takes an array of temperatures and return the temperature closest to 0.


## Input

- N, the number of temperatures to analyse (optional). This will be nonzero.
- The N temperatures expressed as integers ranging from -273 to 5526.


## Output

Output the temperature closest to 0. `If two temperatures are equally close, take the positive one. For instance, if the temperatures are -5 and 5, output 5.`
