# Python Interview Preparing
A collection of Python coding challenges, algorithms, and tips designed to help you prepare for technical interviews just using pure python code.

## Introduction
This repository provides a comprehensive set of Python problems and solutions to help you prepare for coding interviews. It includes various types of problems such as algorithms, data structures, and system design questions. Additionally, you'll find tips and resources to refine your interview skills.

## Getting Started
To get started with the materials in this repository:

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-interview-preparing.git
```

2. **Explore the challenges**: Go through the directories and files to find problems and solutions.
3. **Practice**: Solve the problems on your own before reviewing the provided solutions.


## Configuring Jupyter Notebook

This will be our laboratory, where we can acess the folders studies.

To use Jupyter Notebook within a virtual environment, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   Use `virtualenv` to create a virtual environment with Python 3.7:

   ```bash
   virtualenv --python=/path/to/your/python3.7 <your_env_name>

Replace /path/to/your/python3.7 with the path to your Python 3.7 executable, and <your_env_name> with a name for your environment.

2. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate your virtual environment using:

```bash
source your_env_name/bin/activate
```

3. Install Jupyter and Required Packages

Install Jupyter Notebook and any other necessary packages:

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

4. Add a New Kernel to Jupyter (Optional)

If you want to use the virtual environment as a kernel in Jupyter Notebook, run:


```bash
ipython kernel install --user --name=<your_env_name>
```

5. Install the rest of dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Start Jupyter Notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter-notebook
```
