    "# Python Standard Library\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some Python standard libraries that can help you become proficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`multiprocessing`** - If your program is CPU-bound and you need to use all of your cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`threading`** - If your program needs some lightweight parallelism. For more than lightweight parallelism, ensure you omit the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) by using C/C++ extensions, `numpy`, networking requests, or file read/write operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`argparse`** - The go-to built-in CLI arguments parser, useful for writing scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`collections`** - Especially:\n",
    "  - **defaultdict** - A dictionary that returns a default value for missing keys.\n",
    "  - **OrderedDict** - A dictionary that maintains the order of items.\n",
    "  - **namedtuple** - A lightweight, immutable data structure for storing multiple fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`itertools`** - Especially:\n",
    "  - **chain** - Combines multiple iterables into a single sequence.\n",
    "  - **count** - An infinite iterator that generates consecutive integers.\n",
    "  - **product** - Cartesian product of input iterables.\n",
    "  - **permutations** - Generates all possible orderings of a given sequence.\n",
    "  - **combinations** - Generates all possible combinations of a given length.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`re`** - Remember to use `re.search` instead of `re.match`! People often use `match` thinking it has the functionality of `search`, but make sure to read the docs carefully. Additionally:\n",
    "  - **compile** - Compiles a regular expression pattern into a regex object.\n",
    "  - **sub** - Replaces occurrences of a pattern with a string.\n",
    "  - **subn** - Like `sub`, but also returns the number of substitutions made.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`pathlib`** - The `pathlib.Path` type is great for manipulating file paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`os`** - Especially `os.path` for manipulating file paths (many people haven't moved to `pathlib` yet, so it's good to know it). Additionally:\n",
    "  - **os.getenv** - Retrieves the value of an environment variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`datetime`** - To handle dates, get to know:\n",
    "  - **strftime** - Formats date objects as strings.\n",
    "  - **isoformat** - Returns the date in ISO 8601 format.\n",
    "  - **timedelta** - Represents the difference between two dates or times.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`time`** - Particularly:\n",
    "  - **time.time()** - Returns the current time in seconds since the epoch.\n",
    "  - **time.perf_counter()** - Returns a high-resolution timer for performance measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`urllib`** - For manipulating URLs. Don't use regex here! Why? Use `urllib.parse.urlparse`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`unittest`** - The built-in testing library.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`functools`** - Utilities for functional programming. Get to know:\n",
    "  - **wraps** - A decorator that preserves the original function's metadata.\n",
    "  - **reduce** - Applies a function cumulatively to the items of an iterable, reducing it to a single value.\n",
    "  - **partial** - Allows you to fix a certain number of arguments of a function and generate a new function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`operator`** - All the standard operators like `+`, `-`, `/`, etc., but in the form of functions. Useful in combination with `map` or `functools.reduce`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`json`** - Self-explanatory :)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`pprint`** - Just a print, but with better-to-read formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`io`** - File-like objects in memory. Get to know:\n",
    "  - **BytesIO** - In-memory stream for binary data.\n",
    "  - **StringIO** - In-memory stream for text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`random`** - Useful for generating random things, especially strings for a unique ID. Get to know:\n",
    "  - **randint** - Returns a random integer between two specified values.\n",
    "  - **shuffle** - Randomly reorders the elements of a list.\n",
    "  - **seed** - Initializes the random number generator with a seed.\n",
    "  - **choice** - Returns a random element from a non-empty sequence.\n",
    "  - **sample** - Returns a list of unique elements chosen from a population.\n"
